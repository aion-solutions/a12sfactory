DISTRIBUTION
------------

The A12S Factory distribution provides advanced features for content management. It solves some
common issues with a huge use of Paragraphs.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

The distribution relies heavily on Bootstrap 4, to handle the grid feature through paragraph behaviors. This may evolve
if there are some interests in other frameworks, with people able to collaborate on such issue.
